		<p>Hello there! My name is Roberto and I'm currently working on my web development skills everyday. My first taste of programming was back when I was a student at Georgia State University, where I was introduced to Java and Python in my late teens and early twenties. After graduating from school with a bachelor's degree in Computer Information Systems, I decided to teach myself Wordpress and got a job in SEO and online marketing where I learned a lot and got inspired by the web developers and web designers there to take learning the front end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and back end (PHP, MySQL, etc.) seriously.</p>
